# HOME, LOGNAME and USER can get unset: they are typically
# exported by 'login' but ie 'env - bash' can start a new
# shell without it, and a user can unset these variables
# themselves.  *Only* in the case of a login shell,
# 'bash' sets HOME itself from the user pwent.  This code is
# used in tilde expansion, via tilde_expand_word() ->
# sh_get_home_dir(), which we use ourselves to set it for
# the mentioned uncovered cases
#
# UID is always set by the shell to the real UID
#
# TODO: should we be using EUID?
# TODO: how to do this without calling an executable? if so,
#       should probably be in rc.d/ instead of term.d/
#       NOTE: checked in freenode#bash, this facility is simply not available.
#       TODO: submit bug to bashbug with patch to prefill HOME, USER, UID
#	(UID already done).  in meantime, use the 'id' callout, out of necessity
#
[[ $LOGNAME ]] || export LOGNAME=$(id -un $UID)
[[ $USER ]] || export USER=$LOGNAME

# use bash tilde expansion lib to read pw-specified homedir
#
[[ $HOME ]] || eval HOME=~$USER
export HOME
